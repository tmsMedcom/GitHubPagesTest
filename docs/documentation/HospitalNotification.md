# Introduction to HospitalNotification Message

The non-technical documentation gives an introduction to the purpose of the HospitalNotification, whereas this page aims to give a non-technical introduction to the acutal content of the standard. <br> 
In case of discrepancies between to [MedComHospitalNotification Implementation Guide (IG)](https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7dk/dk-medcom-hospitalnotification) and this page, it will be the HospitalNotification IG which should be followed. Please contact fhir@medcom.dk if you find discrepandies.

On the figure below is the overall content of a HospitalNotification message. Each reqtangle represents a profile used in the standard. 
The pink color represents profiles from [MedComCore IG](https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7dk/dk-medcom-core), the yellow color represents profiles from [MedComMessaging IG](https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7dk/dk-medcom-messaging) and the blue color represents profiles from [MedComHospitalNotification IG](https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7dk/dk-medcom-hospitalnotification).
